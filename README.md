### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Hey, my name is Nathan, I'm a Full Stack Developer that is currently working for CoderHeroes in an apprenticeship position as a UX/UI Engineer. I'm very passionate about the design process and artistic styling that frontend development allows for because it allows for a 'different take' on programming.
