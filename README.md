I'm a Web Developer that works with React on the frontend and Node.js and Express.js for the backend.

I love working to solve problems, troubleshoot, and help others when it comes to tech support. I have worked with a variety of developmental and design tools over the years and have a openness and passion for new experiences and learning new things. I hope to be able to fill a senior level position so that I can share the knowledge I have developed over the years.

Fun fact: I build my own computers and in my freetime I help in planning and assembling my friend's hardware.
